<h3>Security</h3>
<p>I value your trust in providing your Personal Information, thus I am striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>


<h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>
<p>This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>


<h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>
<p>This Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. The developer does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case the developer discovers that a child under 13 has provided personal information, I immediately delete this from the App’s servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to take the necessary actions.</p>


<h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>The developer may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>


<p>By downloading or using the App, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the App. You are not allowed to copy or modify the App, any part of the App, or our trademarks in any way. You are not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the App, and you also should not try to translate the App into other languages or make derivative versions. The App itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to the developer Sabbi.</p>


<p>Sabbi is committed to ensuring that the App is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, the developer reserves the right to make changes to the App or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. I will never charge you for the App or its services without making it clear to you exactly what you are paying for.</p>


<p>The Tank Rush app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to the developer, to provide my Service. It is your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the App secure. I therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Tank Rush app won’t work properly or at all.</p>


<p>The App does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions.</p>


<p>Link to Terms and Conditions of third-party service providers used by the App:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Play Services</li>
</ul>


<p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Sabbi will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the App will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but the developer cannot take responsibility for the App not working at full functionality if you do not have access to Wi-Fi, and you do not have any of your data allowance left.</p>


<p>If you are using the App outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the App, or other third-party charges. In using the App, you are accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the App.</p>


<p>Along the same lines, Sabbi cannot take responsibility for the way you use the App, i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, the developer cannot accept responsibility.</p>


<p>With respect to Sabbi’s responsibility for your use of the App, when you are using the App, it is important to bear in mind that although the developer endeavors to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, I do rely on third parties to provide information to me so that I can make it available to you. The developer accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the App.</p>


<p>At some point, the developer may wish to update the App. The App is currently available on Android – the requirements for the system (and for any additional systems the developer decides to extend the availability of the App to) may change, and you will need to download the updates if you want to keep using the App. Sabbi does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you. The developer may also wish to stop providing the App, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless the developer tells you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the App, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>


<h3>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</h3>
<p>The developer may update the Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.</p>


<p>These terms and conditions are effective as of December 27, 2023.</p>
